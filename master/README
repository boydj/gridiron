To launch a Jenkins master, execute the below.

Swarming doesn't seem to work properly right now for slaves, so you'll have to pass the IP address to the slave container to connect.

Change jenkins-home to wherever you want to keep the volume.

docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -p 33848:33848/udp -v /Users/joshboyd/Code/gridiron/jenkins-home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins:dockerfile
